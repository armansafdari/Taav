It is a graphical user interface for Palabos libraries.


This application is written based on Qt 5.12 and Palabos libraries version 2.0. 
It is a preliminary release and I have not fully analysed the performance of the application. 
I distributed this application in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.


The following parts are under development:
-	Adding more LBM dynamics solvers
-	Adding more lattice vector schemes
-	Adding 3D viewer widget and 3D case studies
-	Importing boundary condition file
-	Importing density data file into domain
-	Converting LBM units to real units
-	Converting Material properties to LBM units
-	Importing STL files
-	Adding thermal solver
-	Adding multiphase solvers
-	So on
